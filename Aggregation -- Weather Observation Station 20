A median is defined as a number separating the higher half of a data set from the lower half. Query the median of the Northern Latitudes (LAT_N) from STATION and round your answer to  decimal places.

Input Format

The STATION table is described as follows:

Station.jpg

where LAT_N is the northern latitude and LONG_W is the western longitude.


********* SOLUTION *******

SET @N := 0;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM STATION INTO @TOTAL;
SELECT
    ROUND(AVG(A.LAT_N), 4)
FROM (SELECT @N := @N +1 AS ROW_ID, LAT_N FROM STATION ORDER BY LAT_N) A
WHERE
    CASE WHEN MOD(@TOTAL, 2) = 0 
            THEN A.ROW_ID IN (@TOTAL/2, (@TOTAL/2+1))
            ELSE A.ROW_ID = (@TOTAL+1)/2
    END
;
