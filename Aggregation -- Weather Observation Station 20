A median is defined as a number separating the higher half of a data set from the lower half. Query the median of the Northern Latitudes (LAT_N) from STATION and round your answer to  decimal places.

Input Format

The STATION table is described as follows:

Station.jpg

where LAT_N is the northern latitude and LONG_W is the western longitude.


******** SOLUTION ********

set @a :=0;
select count(*) from station into @b;
select round(avg(c.lat_n),4) 
from (select @a:=@a+1 as r_id, lat_n from station order by lat_n)  c
where case
    when mod(@b,2) =0 then c.r_id in (@b/2,(@b/2+1))
    else c.r_id = (@b+1)/2
      end
;
