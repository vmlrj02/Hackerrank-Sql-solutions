You are given a table, Functions, containing two columns: X and Y.



Two pairs (X1, Y1) and (X2, Y2) are said to be symmetric pairs if X1 = Y2 and X2 = Y1.

Write a query to output all such symmetric pairs in ascending order by the value of X. List the rows such that X1 â‰¤ Y1.

Sample Input



Sample Output

20 20
20 21
22 23



********* SOLUTION ********

select f1.x,f1.y from functions as f1
join functions as f2
on f1.x=f2.y and f1.y=f2.x
group by f1.x,f1.y
having count(*) >1 or f1.x<f1.y
order by f1.x
